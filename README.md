# Restaurant Reviews App
---


### Introduction

This application shows a map with restaurant markers, a filter which allows the user to select the desired zone or restaurant type, a list of restaurants and the actual reviews page of each of the available restaurants.

The application has been improved in order to be responsive, have accesibility features and cache the requests in order to be available offline.

### How to start the app:

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 
Using the latest python version, in a terminal, use `python -m http.server 8000` to start the server. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and you will see the app with all the data loaded.
